Hi Julien ,
 i just remembered that i only added mysql connector Jar file, first in classpath and then i had to go to project properties 
and from the menu list i chose deployment assembly and added it there aswell. apart from that everything was installed 
beforehand from eclipse itself. this jar file of mysql i have inserted in this yip folder along with this note. Many thanks
